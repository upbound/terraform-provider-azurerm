## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Nginx Deployment should exist. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Nginx Deployment. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Nginx Deployment should exist. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) Specify the Name of Nginx deployment SKU. The possible value are `publicpreview_Monthly_gmz7xq9ge3py` and `standard_Monthly`.

* `managed_resource_group` - (Optional) Specify the managed resource group to deploy VNet injection related network resources. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

---

* `capacity` - (Optional) Specify the number of NGINX capacity units for this NGINX deployment. Defaults to `20`.

-> **Note** For more information on NGINX capacity units, please refer to the [NGINX scaling guidance documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginxaas/azure/quickstart/scaling/)

* `email` - (Optional) Specify the preferred support contact email address of the user used for sending alerts and notification.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `frontend_private` - (Optional) One or more `frontend_private` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `frontend_public` - (Optional) A `frontend_public` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `logging_storage_account` - (Optional) One or more `logging_storage_account` blocks as defined below.

* `network_interface` - (Optional) One or more `network_interface` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new Nginx Deployment to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Nginx Deployment.
